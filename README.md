> Find Cypress spec files using the config settings

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs
# prints all spec files separated by a comma
cypress/e2e/spec.js,cypress/e2e/featureA/user.js
```

Supports JS and TS specs

## Component specs

By default, it finds the E2E specs and tests. You can find component specs using `--component` CLI option

```
$ npx find-cypress-specs --component
```

## against branch

By default, this module simply prints all spec filenames. You can add `--branch` parameter to only print the specs changed against that `origin/branch`.

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main
# prints only some specs, the ones that have changed against the "origin/main"
```

## set GitHub Actions outputs

If you add `--set-gh-outputs` command line switch, then the number of changed specs and the comma-separated file list will be set as GH Actions outputs `changedSpecsN` and `changedSpecs`. See [pr.yml](./.github/workflows/pr.yml) for example

```yml
- name: Print specs changed against the parent of this branch üå≥
  # and set GitHub Actions output
  id: step1
  run: node ./bin/find --branch main --parent --set-gha-outputs

- name: Print set outputs
  run: echo ${{ steps.step1.outputs.changedSpecsN }} ${{ steps.step1.outputs.changedSpecs }}
```

## against the parent commit

When dealing with a long-term branch, you do not want to see the changed files in the main branch. Instead, you want to only consider the specs changed in the _current_ branch all the way to its parent commit. You can pass the flag `--parent` to only pick the modified and added specs.

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --parent
# same as
# git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AMR $(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)..
```

Note: to get the changed files, we need to fetch the repo, see [pr.yml](./.github/workflows/pr.yml)

```
$ checkout
$ git fetch
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --parent
```

## with traced import and require statements

Imagine you open a pull request and only change something in an `utils.js` file used by other specs. Which specs should you run? By default `--branch main --parent` would not find any changed specs, so no specs would execute, and you will have to run _all_ specs just to be safe. This program has a mode `--trace-imports <subfolder>` which uses [spec-change](https://github.com/bahmutov/spec-change) to inspect JS/TS files and find dependencies between them. Thus it can discover that when `utils.js` changes, the specs that `import './utils'` or `require('./utils')` should also be considered modified.

```
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --parent --trace-imports cypress
```

**Note:** the argument is the subfolder name to limit the number of files to inspect when tracing the imports.

You can time how long tracing takes by adding option `--time-trace` to the command line arguments. You can also saved traced dependencies using `--cache-trace` argument. Next time the dependencies will be loaded from the file without recomputing. This is convenient on CI to avoid recomputing them. For example, if you need the number of affected files and their filenames

```
# get the number of affected specs
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --parent --trace-imports cypress --cache-trace --count
# quickly get the affected specs without recomputing the dependencies
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --parent --trace-imports cypress --cache-trace
```

The cached trace will be saved in file `deps.json`, you probably want to Git ignore it.

You can limit the number of added traced files using the `--max-added-traced-specs <N>` parameter. This avoids ALL specs added when you change some common utility that many specs import.

### number of changed files

You can print just the number of changed specs

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --count
# prints the number of spec files changed against the branch "origin/main"
5
```

### filter by a tag

You can filter all changed specs and only report (and count) the specs that have changed AND include the given tag(s)

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --branch main --tagged @user,@preview
# prints only some specs, the ones that have changed against the "origin/main"
# and that have any tests or suites inside tagged "@user" or "@preview"
```

## Test names

You can print each spec file with the suite and test names inside of it (found using [find-test-names](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-test-names))

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names
# prints something like

cypress/e2e/spec.js (2 tests)
‚îî‚îÄ parent suite [@main]
  ‚îú‚îÄ works well enough
  ‚îî‚îÄ inner suite
    ‚îî‚îÄ shows something [@user]

cypress/e2e/featureA/user.js (2 tests, 1 pending)
‚îú‚îÄ works
‚îî‚äô needs to be written

found 2 specs (4 tests, 1 pending)
```

Where the tags are listed inside `[ ... ]` (see [cypress-grep](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-grep)) and the [pending tests](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-test-statuses/) are marked with `‚äô` character.

You can print the results in JSON format using `--json` or `-j` option.

## Test tags

You can count tags attached to the individual tests using `--tags` arguments

```
$ npx find-cypress-specs --tags
# prints the tags table sorted by tag

Tag    Tests
-----  ----------
@sign  1
@user  2
```

Each tag count includes the tests that use the tag directly, and the _effective_ tags applied from the parent suites.

You can print the results in JSON format using `--json` or `-j` option.

## Test names filtered by a tag

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names --tagged <single tag>
# finds all specs and tests, then filters the output by a single tag
```

## Test names filtered by multiple tags

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names --tagged <tag1>,<tag2>,<tag3>,...
# finds all specs and tests, then filters the output showing all tests
# tagged with tag1 or tag2 or tag3 or ...
```

## Show only the pending tests

You can show only the tests marked with "it.skip" which are called "pending" according to Mocha / Cypress [terminology](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-test-statuses/).

```bash
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names --pending
# --skipped is an alias to --pending
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names --skipped
# prints and counts only the pending tests
cypress/e2e/featureA/user.cy.ts (1 test, 1 pending)
‚îî‚äô needs to be written [@alpha]

found 1 spec (1 test, 1 pending)
```

## Print skipped tests

```
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names --skipped
```

Prints each spec that has skipped tests.

## Count skipped tests

Prints the single number with the count of skipped tests

```
$ npx find-cypress-specs --names --skipped --count

5
```

## cypress.config.ts

If the project uses TypeScript and `cypress.config.ts` then this module uses [ts-node/register](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) to load the config and fetch the spec pattern.

If you are using `import` keyword in your `cypress.config.ts` you might get an error like this:

```
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';
^^^^^^

SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

In that case, add to your `tsconfig.json` file the `ts-node` block:

```json
{
  "ts-node": {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "commonjs"
    }
  }
}
```

See example in [bahmutov/test-todomvc-using-app-actions](https://github.com/bahmutov/test-todomvc-using-app-actions).

**Tip:** read my blog post [Convert Cypress Specs from JavaScript to TypeScript](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-js-to-ts/).

## Details

Cypress uses the resolved [configuration values](https://on.cypress.io/configuration) to find the spec files to run. It searches the `integrationFolder` for all patterns listed in `testFiles` and removes any files matching the `ignoreTestFiles` patterns.

You can see how Cypress finds the specs using `DEBUG=cypress:cli,cypress:server:specs` environment variable to see verbose logs. The logic should be in the file `packages/server/lib/util/specs.ts` in the repo [cypress-io/cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)

## Debugging

Run the utility with environment variable `DEBUG=find-cypress-specs` to see the verbose logs

## NPM module

You can use this module via its NPM module API.

### getSpecs

```js
const { getSpecs } = require('find-cypress-specs')
// somewhere in the cypress.config.js
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
  const specs = getSpecs(config)
  // specs is a list of filenames
}
```

You can pass the `config` object to the `getSpecs` method. If there is no `config` parameter, it will read the config file automatically.

```js
const specs = getSpecs({
  e2e: {
    specPattern: '*/e2e/featureA/*.cy.ts',
  },
})
// ['cypress/e2e/featureA/spec.cy.ts']
```

### getTests

Returns an object with individual test information

```js
const { getTests } = require('find-cypress-specs')
const { jsonResults, tagTestCounts } = getTests()
// jsonResults is an object
// with an entry per spec file
```

See [get-tests.js](./test/npm/get-tests.js) for details and examples.
